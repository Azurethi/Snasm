So the term is normally cooked (canoical w/ echoing), I need raw (non-cano & no echo).
    In more plain english: I need the term to send me individual chars as they come in, and not print them itself.

    - example written in C, but uses lib function (termios > cfmakeraw): 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448944/c-non-blocking-keyboard-input/448982#448982
    - translated from lib functions to ioctl syscalls (still in C):

    I need to go find out what all of the termios consts are in numbers
    then make two termios, one to hold the original settings, one to copy to & modify
    then apply the modified one for the game to work
    then remember to reset to the originals before exiting
